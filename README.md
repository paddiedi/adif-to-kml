# adif-to-kml

A simple Python application to convert radio amateur ADIF data into KML.

NOTE: if the ADIF file does not have KML coordinates, the program will just assume the coordinates to be (0,0), or skip the entry depending on the current settings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Tkinter
- FTFY https://github.com/rspeer/python-ftfy
- PyYAML https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/

For Windows there's a exe. Other people than Windows users, can just download the repo and run it with python.
